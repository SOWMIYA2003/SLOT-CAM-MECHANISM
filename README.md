# SLOT-CAM-MECHANISM
Mini-Project Work
### ABSTARCT
```
My mini-project is about the demonstration of a Slot cam and four slider mechanisms.
So when we talk about mechanisms,they are almost used in our everyday life, we come across them in our day-to-day life. Even a simple machine involves some mechanisms in them.
So this slot cam mechanism is a basic and more general mechanism that is employed in some mechanical machinery that we use in our daily basis life.
The overall aim of this mini-project is to demonstrate the working mechanism of the slot cam and four sliders follower model.
```
### INTRODUCTION
```
Moving to the detailed description of the Model.
Cam is a mechanical device that is used to convert rotary or rotational motion into linear motion.
These kinds of mechanisms can be used for operating valves of internal combustion engines, sewing machines, children's playthings, paper-cutting machines, and weaving textile machinery.
So this device has three parts or components, namely, the axis and base, the shaft (or rotating wheel), and the lever (also known as followers)
So as the name slot cam and the four-slider follower mechanism itself suggested, we have four levers that will slide linearly along the base when a rotational motion is encountered by the shaft or the rotating wheel.
The base comes with a built-in axis enabling the components to be in place while the mechanism is illustrated.
The base is where the sliders sit and the wheel is placed on its axis.
You will get to know the exact model structure in the upcoming slide.

### LITERATURE SURVEY
```
For this mini project of mine,I have referred to some articles online which gives a brief knowledge about the cam design, its measurement, and motion involved. 
I have taken inferences from the article "Mathematical modelling" By tiancheng, "Optimal design" by bouzakis, and "The effects of cam speed" by Tsai. 
Overall inference from those literature survey includes,that
The Cam base and axis play a major supportive role to demonstrate the motions involved. 
The material should be selected based on the requirement of motion to be performed. For example in the case of shaft and followers, the component has to be light weighted to provide the motion with ease, and therefore one can go with materials like brass, cast iron, carbon fibers, and plastic which are light weighted and have good resistance over the base and axis supporting the linear motion. 
However, the material can vary based on the machinery in which the mechanism is being employed. As I said before we tend to use this mechanism in engines, so in that case materials like plastic can't be directly used so we have to go for aluminium, metal, and so on. 
```
### OBJECTIVE AND SCOPE
```
So the objective and scope involve visualizing the cam slot mechanism and understanding them. And to install this kind of mechanism in any machinery, one can prototype a model, see or visualize how it works and then they can go for manufacturing the machinery to avoid any faults.
```
### METHODOLOGY
```
The methodology follows 7 steps which include the design of our 3d model which has to be printed and made into product.The 2-dimensional geometry of the model is constructed using modelling software like auto cad fusion 360 then followed by the construction of the 3-dimensional geometry from the 2d geometry of that model.
Then the 3-dimensional object is exported as a .stl file (stereolithography) for undergoing slicing methods. 
Then we move on to the phase of slicing.We normally use slicing software to generate the .g code which the 3d printers accept and rely on printing. Slicing software is used to generate support structures,and the required parameter like the material type, infill type, and infill percentage can be modified and the model can be printed based on the parameters involved.
After generating the .g code, the file is then stored in a flash drive or pen drive, which is then given to the 3d printer to print the model designed.
This is the overall process of printing a 3d product.
```
### MODELLING OF PARTS
```
Here we have our designed part which involves the 2d and 3d models of our object.
As we saw earlier our 3d product has three parts, the shaft, the lever, and the axis and base.
This is the 2d and 3d geometry of the shaft or the rotating wheel.When we talk about the dimensions.
The outer circle has a diameter of 100 mm, the inner circle has a diameter of 10 mm. And the arc drawn has a diameter of 0.75 mm. And the thickness of the shaft is 10 mm.
Moving to the next part we have the axis and base.
Here the model isn't designed as three different parts. They are designed as the various components in an object.
A central rectangle of length 150mm and breadth 30 mm is drawn and the base is replicated along the 4 sides using the mirror option and then they are joined via the joint tool.The base has a thickness of 10mm.
Moving to the last part, four sliders have to pass through the base and the slider part is sketched as another component of the object .As u can see over here a slider is designed with a dimension of 20 x 10 mm and 60 mm long.Then the one slider designed is replicated with the help of a mirror tool and made into four sliders on the base.
This slide has the assembled parts of the model.As u can see the four sliders sit on the base path and the shaft is placed on its axis.
```
### SLICING OF PARTS
```
After getting ready with the 3-dimensional .stl files of the object or product.
The STL file is opened in a slicing software where it gets sliced as per the infill type, infill percentage, material selected and 3d printer selected.
Here in my mini-project. I have used ENDER 3d printing machine and the material selected is PLA (polylactic acid) and an infill of 40% is given.
This slide shows the slicing of shaft ,in order to print this particular part it takes a time of 2 hours and the weight of the product is about 16g and the PLA required to 3d print this part is 5.45 m.
This slide shows the slicing of the axis and base. Here support structures are added to make the base even.
It takes around 4 hours to print this particular part and it weighs 25 g and a material of 8.48 m is required to print the part.
Lastly, we have our four followers. the time taken is around 2 hours and the product weighs 13 g and the material used comes around 4.42 m.

### 3D PARTS
```
This is the image of our 3d printed part. And I have just displayed it.
Now I would like to assemble it and demonstrate how it works.
```
### RESULT AND CONCLUSION
```
Thus by doing this we attained our result,Which is to visualize and understand the slot cam and four sliding mechanisms.
Through this, we can understand the rotary motion of the shaft and the linear motion of the sliders. 
and how the rotational motion of the shaft is converted into linear motion.
